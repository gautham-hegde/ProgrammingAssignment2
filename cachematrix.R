## The following pair of functions cache the inverse of a matrix


##This function creates a special cache matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of of the matrix object

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
